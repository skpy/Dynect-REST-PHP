# Dynect-REST-PHP

A simple PHP library for using the [Dynect REST API](http://dyn.com/developer).

## About
This is a simple single-file class for accessing the Dynect REST API.

Methods are generally named after the corresponding API endpoint and HTTP verb associated with the desired action:

* PUT /REST/Zone/       == zoneCreate()
* DELETE /REST/Zone/    == zoneDelete()

* PUT /REST/ARecord/    == arecordCreate()
* DELETE /REST/ARecord/ == arecordDelete()

Some endpoints accept variable inputs, in which case discrete methods have been provided to reduce ambiguity. For example, the REST/ARecord/ GET endpoint accepts an optional record ID. Without it, the API returns a list of A records assigned to the specified FQDN. With it, the API returns the specific data of the singularly identified A record. Within Dynect-PHP, this functionality has been made into two separate methods: arecordGetList() and arecordGet().

Most methods return either the data requested from the API endpoint, or boolean false on failure of any sort.

The raw response from the Dynect API is available as a public variable `$response`.

## Usage
```php
include_once( 'dynect.php' );
$customer_name = 'somecustomer';
$user_name = 'someuser';
$password = 'somepass';

$dyn = new Dynect();
if ( $dyn->login( $customer_name, $user_name, $password ) ) {
	// get a list of zones:
	$zones = $dyn->zoneGetlist();
	// show the raw API response for the previous action:
	print_r( $dyn->result );
	
	// create a new zone
	if ( $dyn->zoneCreate( 'hostmaster@example.com', 'example.com', 3600 ) ) {
		echo 'Zone example.com successfully created.';
	}
	// Publish and commit changes
        $published = $dyn->zoneUpdate('example.com', 'publish');

	// Get contents of BIND file 
	// This example shows how to get from disk
        $BIND = file_get_contents('/files/example.com.zone.txt');  

	// Bulk update from BIND file
	$resultBulk = $dyn->bulkUpdate( 'example.com' , $BIND );

	// Track job 
	$job_id = $resultBulk->job_id ; 
	$Jobresult = $dyn->jobGet( $job_id );
	print_r( $Jobresult );
	
	// Publish and commit changes
        $published = $dyn->zoneUpdate('example.com', 'publish');

	
	$dyn->logout();
}
```
